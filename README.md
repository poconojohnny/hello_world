# hello_world
This is the first github repository I've made following the manual.
Now to add some information about myself. I've been a programmer since 1983, right after humanity invented the first and the wheel. I was blessed by having two wonderful parents who supported me emotionally and financially all throughout my and their lives.
I miss them both very much. My life was very stable with older parents but they're gone far too soon for my liking.
Love and miss you both and praying there's a heaven where we'll be reunited with all the doggies who have preceded me.
